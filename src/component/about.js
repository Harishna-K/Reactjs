     <h1>ABOUT FLOWERS</h1>
     <p>The first flowering plants appeared on the Earth around 140 million years ago and today they grow on every continent on the planet, from the highest mountains to the deepest valleys, and even underwater.

Flowering plants come in an extensive range of colours, sizes, shapes and fragrance, with many of them producing fruits and seeds that we use every day for food, cosmetics and medicines.</p>
